                    As a Software Engineer based in San Diego, I bring over {YEAR_WEB_DEV} years of expertise in full-stack development, eCommerce, and system integration. I am passionate about collaboration and known for driving projects forward by uniting the right people and keeping a clear focus on results. Have you ever been in a meeting where changes are discussed but no one takes the initiative? That is where I step inâ€”I ensure those changes get implemented and things get done.</p>
